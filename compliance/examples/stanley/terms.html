Stanley 1913 Mobile Messaging Terms
Last updated and effective: 09/07/23

The Stanley mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by Pacific Market International, LLC (“Stanley”, “we”, or “us”). Stanley offers recurring text messaging programs and occasional one-time or limited-duration text messaging programs. Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”), as well as our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. For information on how we collect and use your personal information, including in connection with this Service, please see our Privacy Policy. To the extent of any inconsistency, the Mobile Terms in this document will apply to the Service.

We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time. Any such change will take effect when the updated Mobile Terms are posted to our website. (We may also notify you by other means, such as sending a text message to the number you used to sign-up for this Service.)  Your continued consent to receive messages from Stanley following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. (For information on how to withdraw your consent, see below.)

By opting into our Service, you agree to receive recurring text messages from and on behalf of Stanley through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Messages may be in SMS, MMS or RCS format. Message frequency varies. Stanley reserves the right to alter the frequency of messages sent at any time, so as to increase or decrease the total number of sent messages. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system, artificial or pre-recorded voice, or other technology.

We may offer multiple text-messaging programs (e.g., a program for marketing messages and separate programs related to your Stanley account or purchases).

Messages related to an order you’ve placed or your account with Stanley may include updates, alerts, information, order updates, and account alerts (e.g., order updates, account alerts, notification of changes to our terms or policies, etc.).
Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, product launches, sweepstakes or contests, event invitations, sales, and other marketing offers.
We may send reminders based on your activity on our website or app, such as abandoned cart reminders, browse abandonment (e.g., information and alerts based on the products you viewed on our website), and post purchase follow-ups, which may be based on our use of cookies or other tracking technologies when you view content while logged onto your Stanley account.

To opt-in to the Service, please follow the instructions provided by Stanley, which may include providing your phone number online at our website, texting a message to a telephone number or short code, or by otherwise providing your consent. You may need to confirm your consent, such as by replying Y or through another designated response to an initial text message sent to you. By opting into our Service, you represent to us that you are a resident of the United States, at least the age of majority in your place of residence, and that you are the owner of the account associated with the telephone number you have provided (or that you are the customary user of that number on a family or business plan) and that you are authorized to opt into our Service. You consent to the use of an electronic record to document your opting into receive messages through our Service.

You understand that you do not have to sign up for this Service in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase from Stanley. Your participation in this Service is completely voluntary.

We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

To stop receiving text messages from a specific text messaging program offered as part of the Service, text the single keyword command STOP to the telephone number or five-digit short code for the text messaging program from which you no longer wish to receive messages (i.e., the number from which the text messages are being sent) or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. If you have subscribed to more than one Stanley mobile message program and wish to cancel, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions above for each Stanley mobile message program to which you have subscribed.

For support or assistance related to our mobile messaging Service, text HELP to the number from which you received our text messages or email info@stanley-pmi.com.

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

The Service may not be available on all wireless carriers. If your carrier does not participate, you will not receive a reply to your messages. Some operators may not support some services (e.g., pre-paid users may not be able to participate). Stanley and wireless carriers are not responsible or liable for delayed or undelivered messages, or errors in messages. Not all mobile devices may be supported and our messages may not be deliverable in all areas.  You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you change, deactivate, or transfer a mobile number you’ve used to sign-up for our Service, we ask you to notify us of that change by contacting us at info@stanley-pmi.com.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.
